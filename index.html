                    <h2>About Me</h2>
					I am an undergraduate student major in computer science in tsinghua university<br>
					My current research interest lies in interdisciplinary field of computer vision and graphics <br><br>
					
					<h2>Publications</h2>

					<a href="#">Domain Transfer Through Deep Activation Matching</a><br>
					<b>Haoshuo Huang</b> , Qixing Huang, Philipp Kr&auml;henb&uuml;hl<br>
                    ECCV, 2018<br>


                    <h2>RESEARCH EXPERIENCE</h2>
					<b>Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Austin</b> 
					<br>Research Intern, mentored by Prof. Philipp Kr&auml;henb&uuml;hl and Qixing Huang
					<ul>
					  <li>Motivated by reducing domain gap through matching multiple intermediate distributions of dierent
datasets.</li>
					  <li>Implemented a GAN-like network to match multiple distributions using adversarial training; introduced
regularization to get robust performance.</li>
					  <li>Outperformed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation (Cityscapes, SYNTHIA, GTA-dataset) and
digital image classification(MNIST, SVHN, USPS) tasks.</li>
					</ul>


					<b>Technology Strategy Group, Microsoft Research Asia</b> 
					<br>Research Intern, mentored by Eric Chang
					<ul>
					  <li>Detected mitosis (a special kind of cell) using limited numbers of medical images.</li>
					  <li>Implemented a two-step framework to do mitosis detection; coarse ltering using FCN, ne ltering using
well-designed Mitosis-classification network.</li>
					  <li>Took part in the Tumor Proliferation Assessment Challenge 2016, which is a satellite challenge of Medical
Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention(MICCAI).</li>
						<li>Won rank 2 in task1, rank 1 in task2, rank 5 in task 3.</li>
					</ul>

					<b>Student Research Training, Tsinghua University</b> 
					<br>Research Intern, mentored by Mingxing Xu
					<ul>
					  <li>Detected advertisement in a video through processing of audio.</li>
					  <li>Proposed a framework to nd patterns for audio through the use of HASH algorithm.</li>
					  <li>Implemented a media player to automatically deleted the audio.</li>
					</ul>


					<b>Tsinghua SAIL Group, Tsinghua Univeristy</b> 
					<br>Research Assistant, co-worked with Hang Su
					<ul>
					  <li>Do further research in domain adaptation.</li>
					</ul>
					

					<h2>Selected Projects</h2>
					<b>SmartJigsaw:</b>
					A project for automatically playing the jigsaw game; use graph to modelize the game and
solve it using heuristic searching.
					<br><br>
					<b>SmartConnectFour:</b>
					A project for automatically playing the connect four game; using a mixed strategy of
monte carlo and alpha-beta pruning.
					<br><br>
					<b>ICaption:</b>
					A project for doing image captioning; reimplement the original paper.
					<br><br>
					<b>AutoAdaptation:</b>
					A project for doing image captioning; reimplement the original paper.
					<br>
